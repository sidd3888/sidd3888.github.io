                <p><b><u>Beliefs in echo chambers: Characterization and identification</u></b> (with Pranjal Bhushan and Abhinash Borah)</p>

                <p> <b>Abstract:</b> We introduce an interactive model of belief formation and transmission within echo chambers. Individuals in our model have subjective core beliefs, but these are not the same as the beliefs underlying their behavior. An individual's <i>behavioral beliefs</i> incorporate her core beliefs but are also influenced by the behavioral beliefs of others within her echo chamber. Therefore, echo chambers feature interactive behavioral beliefs with any individual's beliefs both being influenced by as well as influencing the beliefs of others in her echo chamber. The <i>echo chamber representation</i> of a profile of such behavioral beliefs that we propose captures the steady state of this process of interaction and influence. We characterize the model based on two axioms. The first emphasizes the need for conformity when it comes to assessments about certain events, while the second highlights the possibility of differing behavioral beliefs about uncertain events and the potential for everyone to exercise influence. We also analyze when the model permits exact identification, i.e., when can an analyst draw on  the profile of behavioral beliefs to uniquely identify  the composition of the echo chambers in society, the core beliefs of different individuals, and the degree to which each of them is immune to influence. Further, we relate our model to leading empirical themes like elite influence, naive updating and stickiness of beliefs within echo chambers.</p>

                <p><b><u>Comparative Ambiguity and Menu Effects</u></b> (advised by Abhinash Borah)</p>
                <p><b>Abstract:</b> I propose a model of decision making under uncertainty that make ambiguity attitudes susceptible to menu effects. The starting point for this exercise is a choice rule defined over finite sets of Anscombe-Aumann acts. Each act is evaluated, in the context of a menu, through (i) a non-comparative component: a vector expected utility evaluation of the act with standard menu-independent parameters (ii) a comparative component: a cost assigned in relation to the other acts in the menu. I introduce a notion of comparative ambiguity, which measures the excess ambiguity to which an act is exposed, against the benchmark of the least ambiguous comparable act in the menu. The decision maker then makes an adjustment in their utility evaluation for this excess. The choice rule is determined by the maximization of this menu-dependent utility. Under minimal assumptions, my model lends to sharp experimental identification of how ambiguity attitudes are susceptible to menu effects. The paper details the underpinnings of the model through an extensive literature review and benchmark its predictions against AI generated responses using GPT-4.</p>

                <h3>Econ-ARK</h3>

                <p><b>Documentation:</b> I assisted in refining multiple pieces of documentation for the HARK toolkit, especially in terms of the explanatory guides for installation and demonstration purposes. Through, this work, I also forayed into the world of computational macroeconomics, particularly heterogenous agent modelling, which I had very little exposure hitherto.</p>

                <p><b>Multivariate Lognormal:</b> I developed a multivariate lognormal class for the HARK toolkit, which was particularly necessary in the absence of similar functionalities in standard libraries like SciPy. Further, I created an algorithm that discretizes any multivariate lognormal distribution and yields an approximation using equiporobable atoms. The details of this feature can be found <a href="https://github.com/econ-ark/HARK/pull/1412">here</a>.</p>

                <p><b>MSM Estimation:</b> I worked on integrating the functionalities of the <code>estimagic</code> library into HARK, particularly also to enable us to calculate with ease the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjx023">Andrews et al. (2017)</a> sensitivity measure. In doing so, I <a href="https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/estimagic/pull/477">contributed</a> to the <code>estimagic</code> library as well, while <a href="https://github.com/llorracc/SolvingMicroDSOPs-Latest/pull/30">testing</a> its compatibility to our needs and writing an appropriate wrapper for its tools.</p>
