                <p><b><u><a href="research/correlated_shocks_equity_premium.pdf">Portfolio choice with correlated income growth and equity return shocks</a></u></b></p>

                <p><b>Abstract:</b> Portfolio choice models normally predict that the portfolio share of equity declines with wealth, while the poor invest all their savings in equity. I examine an infinite-horizon consumption-saving problem where the agent has to decide how to invest their savings between a risky and risk-free asset. Following Viceira (2001), I model permanent income growth shocks as correlated with returns on equity. I find that with moderate levels of relative risk aversion, this correlation lowers the optimal portfolio share of equity at target wealth levels (Kimball's (1991) temperance motive), while inverting the relationship between wealth and equity portfolio share. I find that, under standard calibrations, neither the model with borrowing constraints nor the one with positive unemployment probability can fully explain the equity premium observed in U.S. data without high levels of risk aversion. The calibrated temperance motive may explain the observed equity portfolio share in conjunction with other popular explanations documented in the literature.</p>

                <p><i>Conference Presentations:</i> DSE Winter School 2023, BREW-ESA 2023, ISI ACEGD 2023, Ahmedabad University 2024, AMES-CSW 2024</p>

                <p> <b>Abstract:</b> We introduce an interactive model of belief formation and transmission within echo chambers. Individuals in our model have subjective core beliefs, but these are not the same as the beliefs underlying their behavior. An individual's <i>behavioral beliefs</i> incorporate her core beliefs but are also influenced by the behavioral beliefs of others within her echo chamber. Therefore, echo chambers feature interactive behavioral beliefs with any individual's beliefs both being influenced by as well as influencing the beliefs of others in her echo chamber. The <i>echo chamber representation</i> of a profile of such behavioral beliefs that we propose captures the steady state of this process of interaction and influence. We characterize the model based on two axioms. The first emphasizes the need for conformity when it comes to assessments about certain events, while the second highlights the possibility of differing behavioral beliefs about uncertain events and the potential for everyone to exercise influence. We also analyze when the model permits exact identification, i.e., when can an analyst draw on  the profile of behavioral beliefs to uniquely identify  the composition of the echo chambers in society, the core beliefs of different individuals, and the degree to which each of them is immune to influence. Further, we relate our model to leading empirical themes like elite influence, naive updating and stickiness of beliefs within echo chambers.</p>

                <p><b>Abstract:</b> We introduce a stochastic choice model of peer influence in the context of a cluster network. Our goal is to propose a mechanism through which such peer influence works within clusters and show that the mechanism permits an exact behavioral identification of the clusters that form in society, along with individual preferences and idiosyncratic susceptibilities to influence. Under our mechanism that draws on the idea of influence-based random consideration, the more frequently an alternative is 
                perceived to be chosen in a cluster, the greater the probability that any individual in that cluster considers it. An individual's choice probabilities, in turn, are determined from these consideration probabilities according to the random consideration set rule of Manzini and Mariotti (2014). Influence within clusters is mutual, and the choice procedure we introduce captures the steady-state choice profile of this interactive decision-making process. We establish that these interactions are mutually consistent and such profiles exist. Further, we behaviorally characterize the procedure.</p>

                <p><b><u>Comparative Ambiguity and Menu Effects</u></b> (advised by Abhinash Borah)</p>
                <p><b>Abstract:</b> I propose a model of decision making under uncertainty that make ambiguity attitudes susceptible to menu effects. The starting point for this exercise is a choice rule defined over finite sets of Anscombe-Aumann acts. Each act is evaluated, in the context of a menu, through (i) a non-comparative component: a vector expected utility evaluation of the act with standard menu-independent parameters (ii) a comparative component: a cost assigned in relation to the other acts in the menu. I introduce a notion of comparative ambiguity, which measures the excess ambiguity to which an act is exposed, against the benchmark of the least ambiguous comparable act in the menu. The decision maker then makes an adjustment in their utility evaluation for this excess. The choice rule is determined by the maximization of this menu-dependent utility. Under minimal assumptions, my model lends to sharp experimental identification of how ambiguity attitudes are susceptible to menu effects. The paper details the underpinnings of the model through an extensive literature review and benchmark its predictions against AI generated responses using GPT-4.</p>

                <p><b>Documentation:</b> I assisted in refining multiple pieces of documentation for the HARK toolkit, especially in terms of the explanatory guides for installation and demonstration purposes. Through, this work, I also forayed into the world of computational macroeconomics, particularly heterogenous agent modelling, which I had very little exposure hitherto.</p>

                <p><b>Multivariate Lognormal:</b> I developed a multivariate lognormal class for the HARK toolkit, which was particularly necessary in the absence of similar functionalities in standard libraries like SciPy. Further, I created an algorithm that discretizes any multivariate lognormal distribution and yields an approximation using equiporobable atoms. The details of this feature can be found <a href="https://github.com/econ-ark/HARK/pull/1412">here</a>.</p>

                <p><b>MSM Estimation:</b> I worked on integrating the functionalities of the <code>estimagic</code> library into HARK, particularly also to enable us to calculate with ease the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjx023">Andrews et al. (2017)</a> sensitivity measure. In doing so, I <a href="https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/estimagic/pull/477">contributed</a> to the <code>estimagic</code> library as well, while <a href="https://github.com/llorracc/SolvingMicroDSOPs-Latest/pull/30">testing</a> its compatibility to our needs and writing an appropriate wrapper for its tools.</p>
