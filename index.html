                    Welcome to my website! Here you can find the details of everything pertaining to my work. I have a B.A. (Hons.) and P.G. Diploma in Economics from Ashoka University, and am a budding (and exploring) researcher in various fields of Economics. These include Decision Theory, Macroeconomics, Political Economy, and Development Economics.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I am currently working as a research assistant for EconARK, and working on a few projects in an authorial (some jointly) capacity. Apart from this, I also wrote an undergraduate thesis in Decision Theory.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Work aside, I love watching and playing cricket, listening to and playing music, and try to learn something new almost all the time.
